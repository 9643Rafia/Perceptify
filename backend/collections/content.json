              "explanation": "Production code requires robust error handling, logging, and monitoring. This class wraps detection in a production-ready interface: (1) Logging tracks operations and errors for debugging, (2) Error handling prevents crashes from bad inputs, (3) File validation checks existence before processing, (4) Try-except blocks catch and handle errors gracefully, (5) Performance timing helps optimize and monitor, (6) Type hints improve code maintainability. Returns None on error rather than crashing. This pattern is essential for real-world deployment where inputs may be malformed and reliability is critical.",

Try your own images (upload to notebook)\n2. Experiment with different architectures (ResNet, Xception)\n3. Combine multiple models in an ensemble\n4. Explore audio deepfake detection\n5.
